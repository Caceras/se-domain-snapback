# SE/NU Domain Snapback Scanner - GitHub Pages

This directory contains the static site generated for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Files

- `index.html` - Main page showing latest scan results
- `report-*.html` - Individual report pages for each scan date

## Generation

The static site is automatically generated by `build_static_site.py` which:
1. Reads JSON reports from the `/reports` directory
2. Generates static HTML pages with embedded CSS
3. Creates an index page and individual report pages
4. Outputs all files to this `docs/` directory

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`:
- Triggers after each daily scan completes
- Can also be manually triggered
- Uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy
